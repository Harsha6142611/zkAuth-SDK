# ZKP Authentication üîê

**ZKP Authentication** is a modern, cryptography-based authentication system designed to provide a secure and decentralized alternative to traditional authentication methods like Google Authentication. This system eliminates the need to rely on usernames, passwords, or central servers, which are prone to tampering and breaches. By leveraging **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)**, it ensures secure authentication without revealing confidential data.

## üåü Features

- **No Centralized Data Storage**: Avoids storing sensitive information like usernames and passwords on centralized servers, reducing the risk of breaches.  
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Authenticates users without revealing their secret data.  
- **Cryptographic Security**: Uses public-private key pairs for generating secure challenges.  
- **Account Recovery**: Secure recovery phrases allow users to regain access if they forget their secret key.  
- **Vault Integration**: Provides a secure vault for each user to store sensitive information.

## ‚ùå Traditional Authentication vs. ‚úÖ ZKP Authentication

| Feature                              | Google Authentication ‚ùå      | ZKP Authentication ‚úÖ          |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Centralized Data Storage**         | Yes                           | No                             |
| **Password Usage**                   | Required                      | Not required                  |
| **Vulnerability to Breaches**        | High                          | Minimal                       |
| **Confidential Data Exposure**       | Possible                      | None                          |
| **Account Recovery**                 | Limited or insecure           | Secure with recovery phrase   |
| **User Data Privacy**                | Compromised                   | Fully protected               |

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### 1. **Registration Process**
1. The user registers by choosing a **secret key**.
2. The backend:
   - Generates a **public-private key pair**.
   - Creates a **vault** for the user.
   - Issues a **secure recovery phrase** for future account recovery.
3. The user stores the recovery phrase securely.

---

### 2. **Login Process**
1. The user enters their **secret key** to log in.
2. The backend:
   - Generates a **challenge**.
   - Uses the **private key** to solve the challenge.
   - Sends the proof back to verify the user's authenticity.
3. The authentication process completes without exposing the user‚Äôs secret key.

---

### 3. **Account Recovery**
1. If the user forgets their **secret key**, they can recover the account using the **secure recovery phrase**.  
2. A new **secret key** can be set during the recovery process.

## üîí Security Advantages
- **Privacy**: Sensitive information (like passwords or private keys) is never exposed during authentication.
- **Tamper Resistance**: ZKP ensures that only valid users can authenticate, even if the system is under attack.
- **Decentralized Data**: No sensitive information stored on central servers reduces the attack surface.

---

## üöÄ Technologies Used
- **Cryptography**: For key pair generation and challenge resolution.  
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: To authenticate without exposing sensitive information.  
- **Secure Vaults**: For managing user data.
